>>Git Integration:-Sometimes using Git can be fun or hard, but Visual Studio Code comes with integrated Git that allows for Adding, Committing, Pulling and Pushing Changes to a remote Git repository using a simple GUI.

>>Live Share:-Visual Studio Code Live Share is a feature that enables you to share your VS Code instance, and allow someone remote to control and run other things such as debuggers.

>>Split Views, Zen Mode:-If you like working on multiple open editors in the same project, you will find this feature really interesting. You can press OPT, and click on a file, or right click on a file and choose Open to the Side.

>>Integrated Terminal:-Most of the time when running code, there's usually a terminal open either to the side, or somewhere in your machine.Visual Studio Code comes with an Integrated Terminal accessible through View > Integrated Terminal, and configurable through the settings: "terminal.external.osxExec": "iTerm.app".

>>Plugins and Themes:-Visual Studio Code has a rich plugin API, and this has enabled developers to create really awesome plugins.

>>Helpers (Intellisense, Context Menus):-I decide to call this section helpers because it consists of little things that are quite helpful when writing code.
